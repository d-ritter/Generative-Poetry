Hello and welcome to this project.

This lesson was inspired by a post that I had found by mtchl. n.d. 
on generative poetry. 

To access the lesson that I have created in Google Slides please visit:

Other ways to extend, or challenge students would be to create randomized: 
 - Definite or indefinite articles
 - Checking if the next word is a vowel etc.
 - Randomize different fonts
 - Randomize different colors
 - Randomized background images
