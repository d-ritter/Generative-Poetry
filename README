This project was inspired by a post that I had found by mtchl. n.d. 

To access a lesson that I created in Google Slides please visit:

Other ways to extend this project would be to challenge students to create randomized: 
definite or indefinite articles
Checking if the next word is a vowel etc.
randomize different fonts
randomize different colors
randomized background images
